# FOMOD Plus for Mod Organizer 2
![wizard](./scanner/resources/wizard.gif)

## Overview
A total rewrite of the FOMOD installer.
Supports all features of the original FOMOD installer, and adds a few new ones.

### Features
- Highlight previously selected options. 
- Select previously installed options (where feasible).
- Filter by mods installed via FOMOD. [Pic](doc/filter.png)
- A Scanner plugin to retroactively mark mods as FOMOD-installed where possible. [Pic](doc/scanner-menu.png)
- A nice wizard hat in the content column to indicate the mod was installed via FOMOD. [Pic](doc/content.png)
- Window sizes and splitter positions persist between mod installs.
- FOMOD installer window won't block the main MO2 window. No more quitting the installer to check if you installed A, B, or C.
- Optimized image viewer

### How to Install
1. Unzip the latest release into your MO2 plugins directory.
2. If running for the first time, use the scanner to populate your mods.
3. Install FOMODs as normal and enjoy the new features.

### Future Plans
Since this is a WIP and barely in alpha stages, expect some bugs as things progress. 
Some of my plans, roughly ordered, include:

- [ ] Searchable installation notes (manual input and automatic)
- [ ] Introduce new optional features to the FOMOD XML schema to allow more fun~.

## Developing

Development of this plugin is done within the context of `mob`.
You'll want to follow all setup instructions for `mob` before proceeding.

1. [Set up mob](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/mob) and all of its requirements.
2. Clone this repository inside the generated `<rootDir>/build/modorganizer-super` directory.
3. Open in your IDE of choice. I prefer CLion and it should be fairly painless.

*Note: I don't have a good setup for building to DLLs within the repo at the moment.*

### Environment Variables
I recommend setting the following system environment variables to make 
building super seamless:

| Variable  | Example Value                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| `Qt6_DIR` | `C:\Qt\6.7.1\msvc2019_64\lib\cmake` |


The project is divided into two targets, `fomod_plus_installer` and `fomod_plus_scanner`. Hopefully the 
distinction is self-explanatory.

<details>
  <summary>Technical Reasons</summary>

  MO2 plugin architecture doesn't support providing multiple C++ plugins in one target. Even if it could,
  `FomodPlusScanner` implements `IPluginTool` which conflicts in inheritence with `IPluginInstaller`. 

  Sorry for the headache!
</details>

## Debugging
To debug:
1. Make sure you are debugging the `fomod_plus_installer` target (unless you're debugging the scanner).
2. Set your target executable to the MO2 executable inside `<mobDir>/install/bin`.

*NOTE* Inside `CMakeLists.txt` you'll see a pair of lines like this:
```cmake
#set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_RELWITHDEBINFO ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../../install/bin/plugins)
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_RELWITHDEBINFO "D:/Modding/MO2/plugins")
```
for some reason on my main PC I can't use the `mob`-built MO2 instance to debug without a lot 
of exceptions. This is not the case on my laptop. So if you get lots of exceptions pointing to the 
`mob` dev build, try changing the hardcoded path in that second line to your _real_ MO2 instance.

### NOTE
MO2 upstream dependencies have started migrating to VCPKG and have different builds and sources vs 2.5.2. As such,
have to do some very odd/painful workarounds to build against the stable release. Inside `CMakePresets.json` there's the `DEPENDENCIES_DIR`
variable which you should point to the 2.5.2 sources directory you can download from the MO2 github releases page.
